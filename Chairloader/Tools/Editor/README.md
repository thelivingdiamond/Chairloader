# Chairloader Editor
**The editor is designed to mimic the cryengine game editor, and implements a small subset of those features**

*To launch check `Editor` in the Chair Manager launch options menu. This is a work in progress interface, so stability may suffer while using the editor.*

### Free Cam
- Improved free cam with configurable speed and an inutitive interface

### Entity Selection
- Click on any entity to select it while in free cam mode
- Displays the bounding box of the selected entity

### Hot DLL Reloading
- Reload your mod DLL's while the game is running
- Reloads the level and all entities, so you can see your changes immediately
- This is a very powerful tool for rapid development


### Entity Manipulation
- Edit position, rotation and scale of the selected entity
- Edit the entity's properties
- View script variables of the selected entity
- View physics variables of the selected entity


### Game Pause
- Pause the game while in free cam mode, which freezes all physics and animations
- This allows you to edit entities while the game is running, and then unpause the game to see the changes
