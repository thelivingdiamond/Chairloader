Ok - actually - she said the opposite. &lt;i&gt;I'm&lt;/i&gt; supposed to behave and do what &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; tell me. So there you go. That's Mom.&lt;br&gt;Anyway, everyone's excited about your ideas up there, so get ready. I'll prob call you in the morning to make sure you're up.

Ilyushin's brain has never been scanned, which I also find unusual, especially for a TranStar employee. I requested her files to see if any member of her family had a history of the disorder, but those of her parents are also not accessible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#45;&#45;-&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;From:&lt;/b&gt; Alex Yu&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;To:&lt;/b&gt;Regina Sellers&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Subject:&lt;/b&gt; RE: Patient Access Request&lt;br&gt;Dr. Sellers, Engineer Ilyushin was cleared Earthside.

As you'll see, there's noticeable personality drift, more than I'd expect from heavy Neuromod cycling. It's even more prominent because of the duration in which these behavior shifts have developed. As requested, I did not discuss this with Morgan. Interestingly, Morgan seems unaware of these shifts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As an aside, I believe this poses interesting questions for other applications of the Neuromod - not solely therapy, but re-conditioning.</Data></Cell>

When the cat's away and all that. I think I have a few ideas. I'll draw something up and send it to you and Mary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Clive&lt;br&gt;&#45;&#45;-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;From:&lt;/b&gt; Franklin Goode&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;To:&lt;/b&gt; Clive Lawrence&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Subject:&lt;/b&gt; Dart Effectiveness&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hey Clive,&lt;br&gt;Sorry for the bolts all over the Machine Shop. It's really the only place I can try out the new gun. I think it's coming along rather nicely... still want to help? I've already recruited Mary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Franklin</Data></Cell>

    <Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Set up a reoccurring task for setting Morgan's keypad. We're getting code change requests every month. It's the same pattern - Morgan asks us what the current code is, asks if it was requested or if we chose it, then asks for a new one. It's unusual. Last time she asked, I was right there - so I told her the code and she gave me a blank look - a code we'd set less than a week ago. Maybe she's testing our response time?</Data></Cell>
