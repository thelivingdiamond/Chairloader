# Chairloader
#### *By thelivingdiamond & tmp64*
Chairloader is a modding framework built for Prey (2017) developed by Arkane. First and foremost chairloader is designed to enable modders to make mods for Prey on a scale never before seen. With realtime mod DLL loading modders are now given the ability to change not just the assets, but the code at the core of the game. There is a GUI built in with several functions to aid in modding (or messing around). Learn more below
