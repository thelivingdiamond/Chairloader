Engine Source Code
===================
Prey (2017) is based on CRYENGINE version 3/4. CRYENGINE 5 and newer has public source code.

CRYENGINE versions 5.0-5.6 used to be available in a [public repo](https://github.com/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE) on CRYTEK's GitHub.  
The repo has been removed soon after the release of CRYENGINE 5.7 LTS, and required SDKs went along with it.

CRYENGINE 5.2
----------------
This is the closest public version to the one used in Prey.  
For Chairloader development, it can be found in a [mirror](https://github.com/tmp64/CRYENGINE_Chairloader).

Notable differences from Prey's engine are:
- File structure in `CryCommon` split by engine modules. CRYENGINE 3 and Prey have all files in one directory.
- Different _(how?)_ entity archetype code.

CRYENGINE 5.7
----------------
This version is hosted in a [private repository](https://github.com/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE_Source).  
To get access to it, you need to fill out a form. [Check here for details](https://github.com/CRYTEK/CRYENGINE_ReadMe).
