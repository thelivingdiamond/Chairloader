# Chairloader Tools
**These are internal modules that provide an array of useful functions in game. They possess many trainer-like features, including entity, player, and world manipulation. They are a statically linked library that is compiled into the main chairloader DLL.**

## Entity Manager
There are two primary functions in this module: the entity spawner and the entity list.


**The entity spawner is used to spawn entities. It can spawn any archetype that is loaded into the game, and can specify a position, faction, quantity, etc..**

**The entity list is a list of all entities in the game. It can be used to select entities and change their position, faction, and orientation. Additionally, for NPC's there are more options available.**
