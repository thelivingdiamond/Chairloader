<!--
	This file contains all known PreyDll.dll versions to Chairloader.
	Currently Chairloader only works with one specific version of Prey
	that was released along with PDB files for it.
	Other versions must be converted into that version.

	To convert between versions the mod loader uses custom diff files.
	They describe how to assemble one file using the contents of another.
	No game binaries are distributed along with Chairloader.
	The name of the diff file is "[first 16 chars of installed version SHA256].diff.gz".

	Format:
		SHA256: hash of the DLL file
		ReleaseDate: when it was released in YYYY-MM-DD format or 0000-00-00 if unknown. Look for "BuildTime: " in the binary.
		Type: which online store it is distibuted in (Steam, GOG, EGS, MS)
		SteamManifest: (optional) Manifest ID in Steam. Can be used to download a specific version of the game.
		IsSupported: (optional) whether the version is supported by Chairloader.
		IsOutdated: (optional) whether the version is outdated and its support was removed.
